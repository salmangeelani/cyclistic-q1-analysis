## 📌 Project Objective

This project analyzes Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 ride data from Cyclistic (based on Divvy) to uncover behavioral differences between **annual members** and **casual riders**. The goal is to support data-driven marketing strategies that increase memberships.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Annual members** took more consistent rides even during winter and early spring.
- **Casual riders** had lower activity in Q1, suggesting seasonal and recreational use.
- Contrary to full-year trends, members had slightly **higher average ride lengths** during Q1.

> 🧠 *Note: This analysis includes only Q1 (Jan–Mar) data. Full-year trends may differ.*
